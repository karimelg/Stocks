Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in
California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015,
we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet became the
successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online
advertising, cloud-based solutions that provide customers with platforms, collaboration tools and
services, and sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital
content and subscriptions for digital content, and hardware. Basis of Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities
consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information The Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\'
Equity for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 and the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 are unaudited. These unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In our opinion, the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for
the fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2021, our results of operations for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, and our cash flows for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 and 2021. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC. Use of Estimates Preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing
basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair
values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and
property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our
estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities. The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $789 million and $719 million
as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. Change in Accounting Estimate In
January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network
equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and
the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in
accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of
servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020, and those acquired during the
quarter ended March 31, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation
expense of $835 million and an increase in net income of $650 million, or $0.97 per basic and $0.95
per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Prior Period Reclassifications

Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of

Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $3.0

Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts,

We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within

fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these

marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and
non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity
method. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value
and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for
identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar
instruments in active markets. Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately
held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our
non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical
or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement
alternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based
on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy
because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of
the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including
volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity
securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Gains and
losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities Gains and losses reflected in other
income (expense), net, for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized
below (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2021 Net gain (loss) on equity securities
sold during the period $ 171 $ 201 Net unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end
of the period (985) 4,636 Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ (814) $
4,837 In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the
difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the
beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity
securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents
the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While
these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are
important supplemental information as they reflect the economic realized net gains on the securities
sold during the period. Cumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price
and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period. Equity Securities Sold

the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense),
net. We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business
operations. The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use
foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in
foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We
also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance
investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination
of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options
are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We
primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other
income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed
below. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net
settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security
arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain
financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received
related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other
current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to
derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current
assets. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including
collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have matu rities of 24 months or less. Cash
flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude
the change in forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial
value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging
instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded
component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions
become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are reclassified to other
income (expense), net in the period of de-designation. As of March 31, 2021, the net accumulated
gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $143 million, which is expected
to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We
designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks
for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts
included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net,
along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in
forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded
component in other income (expense), net. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency
forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our
investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of
hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment.
We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize
changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. Other Derivatives Other
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward
contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on
these contracts, as well as the related costs, are recognized in other income (expense), net, along
with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. We also use
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,
commodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to
time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity
securities. Gains (losses) arising from these derivatives are reflected within the "other" component
of other income (expense), net and the offsetting recognized gains (losses) on the marketable
equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity securities, net component of other
income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. The gross

agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification

involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have a limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not had a

2010, the EC\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various
antitrust-related complaints against us. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that
certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and
ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of
June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27,
2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC\'s
decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On July
18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related
distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3
billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On
October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to
certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in
the second quarter of 2018. On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain
contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed
European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March
20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners\' agreements, which we
implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized
a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. While each EC decision is under
appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. From
time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition
matters by regulatory authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. For example,
in August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of
Justice ("DOJ") requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations
and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a
lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and
Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed
an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws
relating to its advertising technology. We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend
ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their investigations into
certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the
United States, and other regulators around the world. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We
have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us
claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\' intellectual
property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary
damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain
features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business
practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of
revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade
Commission ("ITC") has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property
disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing
products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could
have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into
the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore,
many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against
certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of
defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse
ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our
products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in
loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. ("Oracle")
brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that
Google\'s Android operating system infringes Oracle\'s copyrights related to certain Java application
programming interfaces (“Java APIs”). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in
favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle
appealed and on March 27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the
case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal
Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we
filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the
Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September
27, 2019, the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response
on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a
decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7,
2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit\'s ruling and found that
Google’s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law. The Supreme Court remanded the
case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion.
Other We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and
other proceedings involving competition, intellectual property, privacy, tax and related compliance,
labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services
offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and
other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings
could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring
obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and
operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could
harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Certain of these
outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We
record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or
range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate
developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously
accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments
as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the
estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding matters, based
on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not,
either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is
inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We expense legal fees in the
period in which they are incurred. Non-Income Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and
foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income
tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies Nature of Operations Google was incorporated in
California in September 1998 and re-incorporated in the State of Delaware in August 2003. In 2015,
we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet became the
successor issuer to Google. We generate revenues by delivering relevant, cost-effective online
advertising, cloud-based solutions that provide customers with platforms, collaboration tools and
services, and sales of other products and services, such as apps and in-app purchases, digital
content and subscriptions for digital content, and hardware. Basis of Consolidation The
consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities
consolidated under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and
transactions have been eliminated. Unaudited Interim Financial Information The Consolidated
Balance Sheet as of March 31, 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Income for the three months
ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Comprehensive Income for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, the Consolidated Statements of Stockholders\'
Equity for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 and the Consolidated Statements of
Cash Flows for the three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021 are unaudited. These unaudited
interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States ("GAAP"). In our opinion, the unaudited interim
consolidated financial statements include all adjustments of a normal recurring nature necessary for
the fair presentation of our financial position as of March 31, 2021, our results of operations for the
three months ended March 31, 2020 and 2021, and our cash flows for the three months ended
March 31, 2020 and 2021. The results of operations for the three months ended March 31, 2021
are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for the year ending December 31, 2021.
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements should be read in conjunction with the
consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form
10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 filed with the SEC. Use of Estimates Preparation
of consolidated financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires us to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from these estimates. On an ongoing
basis, we evaluate our estimates, including those related to the allowance for credit losses, fair
values of financial instruments, intangible assets and goodwill, useful lives of intangible assets and
property and equipment, income taxes, and contingent liabilities, among others. We base our
estimates on assumptions, both historical and forward looking, that are believed to be reasonable,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities. The allowance for credit losses on accounts receivable was $789 million and $719 million
as of December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, respectively. Change in Accounting Estimate In
January 2021, we completed an assessment of the useful lives of our servers and network
equipment and adjusted the estimated useful life of our servers from three years to four years and
the estimated useful life of certain network equipment from three years to five years. This change in
accounting estimate was effective beginning in fiscal year 2021. Based on the carrying value of
servers and certain network equipment as of December 31, 2020, and those acquired during the
quarter ended March 31, 2021, the effect of this change in estimate was a reduction in depreciation
expense of $835 million and an increase in net income of $650 million, or $0.97 per basic and $0.95
per diluted share, for the three months ended March 31, 2021. Prior Period Reclassifications

Obligations We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of
our performance, including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to
Google Cloud and Google other. Our total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2020 was $3.0

Additionally, we have performance obligations associated with commitments in customer contracts,

We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as available-for-sale, within
Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or
alternative pricing sources and models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.
For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in
fair value are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these
securities to align with the unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized
net gains related to debt securities still held where we have elected the fair value option were $87

marketable equity securities, non-marketable equity securities, gains and losses on marketable and
non-marketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity
method. Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value
and classified within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for
identical assets in active markets or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar
instruments in active markets. Our non-marketable equity securities are investments in privately
held companies without readily determinable market values. The carrying value of our
non-marketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable transactions for identical
or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement
alternative). Non-marketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based
on observable transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy
because we estimate the value based on valuation methods which may include a combination of
the observable transaction price at the transaction date and other unobservable inputs including
volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of non-marketable equity
securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3. Gains and
losses on marketable and non-marketable equity securities Gains and losses reflected in other
income (expense), net, for our marketable and non-marketable equity securities are summarized
below (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2021 Net gain (loss) on equity securities
sold during the period $ 171 $ 201 Net unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end
of the period (985) 4,636 Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ (814) $
4,837 In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the
difference between the sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the
beginning of the period or the purchase date, if later. Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity
securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following table (in millions), represents
the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity security. While
these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are
important supplemental information as they reflect the economic realized net gains on the securities
sold during the period. Cumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price
and the initial purchase price for the equity security sold during the period. Equity Securities Sold

losses recorded in other income (expense), net, and included as adjustments to the carrying value
of non-marketable equity securities (in millions): Three Months Ended March 31, 2020 2021
Unrealized gains $ 356 $ 4,678 Unrealized losses (including impairment) (1,304) (2) Total
unrealized gain (loss) for non-marketable equity securities $ (948) $ 4,676 During the three months
ended March 31, 2021, included in the $23.3 billion of non-marketable equity securities, $10.3
billion were measured at fair value primarily based on observable market transactions, resulting in a
net unrealized gain of $4.7 billion. Equity securities accounted for under the Equity Method As of
December 31, 2020 and March 31, 2021, equity securities accounted for under the equity method
had a carrying value of approximately $1.4 billion and $1.6 billion, respectively. Our share of gains
and losses including impairment are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in
the Consolidated Statements of Income. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense),
net. We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business
operations. The primary risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use
foreign currency contracts to reduce the risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in
foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations. We
also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to other risks and enhance
investment returns. We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the
fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts (an option strategy comprised of a combination
of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the purchased and written options
are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross fair values. We
primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other
income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed
below. We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net
settlement of transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security
arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain
financial instruments fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received
related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other
current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and non-cash collateral pledged related to
derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other current
assets. Cash Flow Hedges We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including
collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge certain forecasted revenue transactions denominated in
currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have matu rities of 24 months or less. Cash
flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude
the change in forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial
value of the excluded component is amortized on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedging
instrument and recognized in revenues. The difference between fair value changes of the excluded
component and the amount amortized to revenues is recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions
become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI are reclassified to other
income (expense), net in the period of de-designation. As of March 31, 2021, the net accumulated
gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect was $143 million, which is expected
to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months. Fair Value Hedges We
designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks
for our investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts
included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net,
along with the offsetting gains and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in
forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded
component in other income (expense), net. Net Investment Hedges We designate foreign currency
forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks related to our
investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of
hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment.
We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize
changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net. Other Derivatives Other
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward
contracts that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities
denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on
these contracts, as well as the related costs, are recognized in other income (expense), net, along
with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilities. We also use
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,
commodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to
time, we enter into derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity
securities. Gains (losses) arising from these derivatives are reflected within the "other" component
of other income (expense), net and the offsetting recognized gains (losses) on the marketable
equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity securities, net component of other
income (expense), net. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net. The gross

2010, the EC\'s Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various
antitrust-related complaints against us. On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that
certain actions taken by Google regarding its display and ranking of shopping search results and
ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of
June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision and on September 27,
2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into compliance with the EC\'s
decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. On July
18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Android-related
distribution agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3
billion ($5.1 billion as of June 30, 2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On
October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to
certain of our Android distribution practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in
the second quarter of 2018. On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain
contractual provisions in agreements that Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed
European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine of €1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of March
20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners\' agreements, which we
implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision. We recognized
a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of 2019. While each EC decision is under
appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities on our Consolidated
Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines. From
time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition
matters by regulatory authorities in the United States, Europe, and other jurisdictions. For example,
in August 2019, we began receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of
Justice ("DOJ") requesting information and documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations
and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number of state Attorneys General filed a
lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws relating to Search and
Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General filed
an antitrust complaint against Google in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of
Texas, alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws
relating to its advertising technology. We believe these complaints are without merit and will defend
ourselves vigorously. The DOJ and state Attorneys General continue their investigations into
certain aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the
United States, and other regulators around the world. Patent and Intellectual Property Claims We
have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us
claiming that certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others\' intellectual
property rights. Adverse results in these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary
damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or orders preventing us from offering certain
features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have to change our business
practices, and develop non-infringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss of
revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade
Commission ("ITC") has increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property
disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing
products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important market, a prohibition on importation could
have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing many important products into
the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products. Furthermore,
many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against
certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of
defending such claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse
ruling in any such claims. In addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our
products, services, and technologies, as a result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in
loss of revenues and adversely affect our business. In 2010, Oracle America, Inc. ("Oracle")
brought a copyright lawsuit against Google in the Northern District of California, alleging that
Google\'s Android operating system infringes Oracle\'s copyrights related to certain Java application
programming interfaces (“Java APIs”). After trial, final judgment was entered by the district court in
favor of Google on June 8, 2016, and the court decided post-trial motions in favor of Google. Oracle
appealed and on March 27, 2018, the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals reversed and remanded the
case for a trial on damages. On May 29, 2018, we filed a petition for a rehearing at the Federal
Circuit, and on August 28, 2018, the Federal Circuit denied the petition. On January 24, 2019, we
filed a petition to the Supreme Court of the United States to review the case. On April 29, 2019, the
Supreme Court requested the views of the Solicitor General regarding our petition. On September
27, 2019, the Solicitor General recommended denying our petition, and we provided our response
on October 16, 2019. On November 15, 2019, the Supreme Court granted our petition and made a
decision to review the case. The Supreme Court heard oral arguments in our case on October 7,
2020. On April 5, 2021, the Supreme Court reversed the Federal Circuit\'s ruling and found that
Google’s use of the Java APIs was a fair use as a matter of law. The Supreme Court remanded the
case to the Federal Circuit for further proceedings in conformity with the Supreme Court opinion.

other matters. Such claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, and other proceedings
could result in substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring
obligations, changes to our products and services, alterations to our business models and
operations, and collateral related civil litigation or other adverse consequences, all of which could
harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating results. Certain of these
outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We
record a liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred and the amount
can be reasonably estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or
range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate
developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount of liability that has been previously
accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and make adjustments
as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both likelihood of there being and the
estimated amount of a loss related to such matters. With respect to our outstanding matters, based
on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range of reasonably possible loss will not,
either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our business, consolidated
financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such matters is
inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties. We expense legal fees in the
period in which they are incurred. Non-Income Taxes We are under audit by various domestic and
foreign tax authorities with regards to non-income tax matters. The subject matter of non-income
tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied to the sale of our
products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We
accrue non-income taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with,
these tax authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss
is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably
possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process
in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially different from our expectations. For
